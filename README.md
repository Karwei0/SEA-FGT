# SEA-FGT: Frequency-Guided Transformer with Semantic Expert Augmentation

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of the paper: **"SEA-FGT: Semantic Expert Augmentation with Frequency-Guided Transformer for Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection."**

---

## 🌟 Overview

**SEA-FGT** is a robust contrastive learning framework designed for multivariate time-series anomaly detection in real-world industrial systems. By leveraging a positive-sample-only strategy, the model effectively addresses three critical challenges:

* **Complex Inter-channel Dependencies:** Explored via the **Channel Correlation Exploration (CCE)** module.
* **Heterogeneous Temporal Semantics:** Captured through the **Semantic Expert Augmentation (SEA)** module.
* **Frequency-Domain Perturbations:** Modeled by the **Frequency-Guided Transformer (FGT)** to detect anomalies that are subtle in the time domain but prominent in the spectral domain.

### 📊 Advanced Evaluation Metrics

Beyond traditional point-wise metrics, this framework supports **range-oriented evaluation** to ensure fair and stable performance assessment:

* **Affiliation Metrics:** Affiliation Precision / Recall / F1
* **Volume Under Surface:** VUS-ROC / VUS-PR
* **Range-based AUC:** Range-AUC-ROC / Range-AUC-PR

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Environment

We recommend using **Python 3.10** and **PyTorch 2.7.1**. You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Data Preparation

Download the pre-processed datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RaIJQ8esoWuhyphhmMaH-VCDh-WIluRR). Place the folders (e.g., `PSM`, `SMD`) into the `./datasets/` directory.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Training & Evaluation

To train the model and evaluate it on a specific dataset:

```bash
python run.py --dataset PSM --exp_name my_experiment --is_training 1

```

### Inference Only

To run inference using a pre-trained checkpoint (ensure `exp_name` matches the training session):

```bash
python run.py --dataset PSM --exp_name my_experiment --is_training 0

```

### Batch Execution

Alternatively, use the provided shell scripts for one-click execution:

```bash
sh scripts/run.sh

```
